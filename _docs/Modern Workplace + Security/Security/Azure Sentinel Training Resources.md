# Azure Sentinel Readiness Resources

Below you will find content to assist in upskilling on Azure Sentinel. Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

## Keeping Up
* [Azure Sentinel Technical Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/)

### Risk IQ Integration

* [RiskIQ Illuminate Content hub solution within Microsoft Sentinel – My Faber Security](https://myfabersecurity.com/2022/03/04/riskiq-illuminate-content-hub-solution-within-microsoft-sentinel/)
   * Solution under Content Hub **RiskIQ Illuminate**. Reference: [Azure-Sentinel/Solutions/RiskIQ/Playbooks at a18c064b8016db9c7f01c8e856c6c13c98e712d0 - Azure/Azure-Sentinel (github.com)](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/a18c064b8016db9c7f01c8e856c6c13c98e712d0/Solutions/RiskIQ/Playbooks)
   * As the link states, you have to request a [trial key](https://community.riskiq.com/home) (see [account settings](https://community.riskiq.com/settings)). The trial takes a little while to kick in, so if you get a 402 error while testing, just wait a little longer to test.

### Repositories

### Other Useful Information for Partners

#### Storage options

* [MSSP Whitepaper](http://aka.ms/azsentinelmssp)
   * Azure Log Analytics/Azure Sentinel
   * Azure Data Explorer (ADX) – less expensive - but same KQL queries, no UEBA, no visual investigation, less performance
   * Azure Blob Storage – least expensive – query using **_externaldata_** operator in KQL
   * ADX and Blob Storage combined – best of both worlds – data in storage, but you can run KQL queries – you create an **external table in ADX** that points to the whole container (blob storage)
   * **NEW** - [Ingest, Archive, Search, and Restore Data in Microsoft Sentinel - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/ingest-archive-search-and-restore-data-in-microsoft-sentinel/ba-p/3195126)
      * Logs that can work as Basic Logs rather than Analytics Logs are flipped to Basic Logs (Basic Logs are 60% cheaper)
      * Data can be archived from Basic Logs and Analytics logs to Archive (cold) storage. (Logs in cold storage are 80% cheaper than retention in the log analytics database)
      * When needed for forensic and audit reasons, archive data is rehydrated so it can be searched. (Pay-to-use for each search of archived data.)
   * NEW - [Microsoft Sentinel Support for Ingestion-Time Data Transformations - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/microsoft-sentinel-support-for-ingestion-time-data/ba-p/3244531)
      * Ingestion time transformations and Data Collection Rules (DCR)-based custom logs
      * Cost reduction - using ingestion time transformations, customers can now filter out data which is irrelevant to security analysis.
      * [Library of Transformations](http://aka.ms/sentinel-transforms)

#### Cost calculator

* [Sentinel Cost Calculator](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/download?assetname=assets/Azure_Sentinel_Calculator.xlsx&download=1)
* [Azure Data Explorer Cost Calculator](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/AzureDataExplorerCostEstimator.html)

#### Some data at **no cost:**

* Azure Sentinel and Log Analytics offer ingestion & 90 day retention of some data at no cost. Those include:
   * Azure Activity Logs
   * Office 365 Audit Logs (all SharePoint, Exchange admin activity, Teams)
   * Alerts from Microsoft Defender products: Defender for Cloud, Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Azure Information Protection
   * Azure Information Protection alerts (when available)
   * Defender for IOT (alert)
