## Hands on lab

* [Microsoft Purview Workshop](https://github.com/tayganr/purviewlab) (Hands on lab / workshop)
   * The resources within the lab environment are relatively cost-effective as the team chose affordable SKU’s as part of the template (e.g. Serverless Azure SQL DB, Synapse Workspace standalone (without a dedicated SQL Pool), Data Lake Storage, etc). To run the lab for a day it would cost <$10 USD. The Microsoft Purview account would be the most expensive component. This is mainly attributed to the cost of the Capacity Units needed to keep the platform running. The number of [Capacity Units](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/purview/) required at any point in time is auto-determined by the service (auto-scales), if the service is not being used, there will be a minimum of 1 Capacity Unit per hour charged to keep the account active.
