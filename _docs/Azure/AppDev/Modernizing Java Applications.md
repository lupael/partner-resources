## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Microsoft Azure contains native support for Java applications and the Java ecosystem. Java developers can continue using their favorite development environments, plugins, package managers, code repositories, and Life Cycle Management Tools, when deploying to Azure.

Many companies have successfully migrated their Java applications to Microsoft Azure, including the following:

* [Raley's](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-gb/story/1388620728739667057-raleys-uses-azure-spring-cloud-to-optimize-scale-and-drive-innovation)
* [Swiis Re](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-gb/story/1358540087031302788-swiss-re-accelerates-java-app-modernization-using-azure-spring-cloud)
* [Bosch](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-gb/story/1475571259638279673-bosch-delivers-supply-chain-efficiencies-java-azure)

This document describes an approach to modernizing Java applications to optimize the benefits of migrating an application to Azure.

### <a name="why"></a>Why Modernize?

Existing Java applications that run well on-premise may not be designed to take advantage of the flexibility and scalability that Microsoft Azure provides.

When considering migrating an application to Azure, it is useful to modernize the application and make it "cloud native" to better take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing. While a "lift and shift" approach - running your applications and data on virtual machines in the cloud - may work, it is likely to be inefficient. By architecting your application into distinct services that can be developed deployed and managed separately, you can increase the flexibility, maintainability, and scalability of your application. Microsoft Azure offers hundreds of managed services that free the developer from maintaining the underlying infrastructure of the application, allowing them to focus on solving business problems.

We have included links to resources recommended for partners looking to migrate their Java applications to Azure and will cover mainstream Java on Azure scenarios.  Readers can expect to learn how to migrate different types of Java applications to Azure, and understand how to build, deploy, and monitor those applications on Azure for their customers.

#### <a name="costbenefit"></a>Costs vs Benefits

Migrating an application to Azure provides potential cost savings. By renting compute and storage resources instead of buying them, we move from Capital Expenses to Operating Expenses. For volatile workloads, this can offer significant savings, as we don't need to pay for excess capacity when demand is low.

The [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) allows you to estimate the cost of an application deployed to Azure.

## <a name="envisioning"></a>Envisioning

An Envisioning Session is useful to exchange knowledge and determine if the project is appropriate for modernization.

The goals of an Envisioning Session are:

* Establish a clear understanding of business objectives
* Define how a potential solution would be used and how its performance should be measured
* Understand the capabilities of the development team and address any gasp
* Make sure all parties have the same understanding of the scope of the project
* Clearly communicate the next steps

At the end of the Envisioning Session, both parties should reach an agreement whether and when to proceed with the project.

## <a name="ads"></a>Architecture Design Sessions

A key part of any application modernization project is to conduct an Architecture Design Session (ADS) with the customer or partner. An ADS allows us to define and agree upon the architecture and scope of the application, making it easier to plan the development.

This is ideally done in-person to avoid distractions; however, it can also be accomplished successfully remotely or as a hybrid event with some attendees meeting in person and others participating virtually.

Below we cover ADS details for SI partners and for ISVs.

## <a name="adspartner"></a>Architecture Design Session for Services Partners

This guidance is specifically for Microsoft service partners (consulting companies, system integrators, managed service providers, Cloud Solution Providers, etc.) that are interested in modernizing their customer's Java workloads on Azure.

Microsoft provides resource for partners throughout the entire modernize journey. The journey is divided into distinct stages.

## <a name="adsisv"></a>Architecture Design Session for ISVs

The goals of an Architectural Design Session are:

* Align the specific capabilities of the Azure platform with the requirements of the customer's project
* Identify areas of risk and prioritize design and development tasks

The steps for a successful ADS are:

* Planning
* Delivery
* Follow-up

### Planning

Before the ADS, establish the objectives you wish to achieve. Then, determine and prioritize the topics to cover. From this, create an agenda.

Collect any relevant artifacts that will assist in designing the architecture. This can include descriptions and diagrams of existing systems, as well as documentation on their roadmap.

Identify the right people to attend the ADS. From your side, this should be a project owner and the subject-matter experts on the required technologies. From the customer's side, this should be the product owner and the architect who will work on the project.

Decide when, where, and how to host the ADS. Ideally, this will be on-site and away from the customer's work environment. This is not always possible, so you may choose to host the ADS virtually or hold a hybrid event in which some attend in-person and others attend virtually. The important thing is that we remove the participants from potential distractions, so they can focus on the ADS.

Depending on the scope of the project, an ADS can last anywhere from 4 hours to 3 day.

Here is a sample agenda for a 2-day ADS:

Day 1:

| When| What |
| --- | --- |
| 9:00AM-9:15AM | Introduction |
| 9:15AM-Noon | Discovery Session: Review existing subsystems and requirements |
| Noon-1:00PM | Lunch |
| 1:00PM-3:00PM | Azure Technologies Walkthrough |
| 3:00PM-5:00PM | Architecture and Solution Design |

Day 2:

| When| What |
| --- | --- |
| 9:00AM-Noon | Architecture and Solution Design |
| Noon-1:00PM | Lunch |
| 1:00PM-3:00PM | Architecture and Solution Design |
| 3:00PM-4:30PM | Plan Next Steps |

#### Kickoff

Begin with a brief kickoff: Recap the purpose of the session; allow attendees to briefly introduce themselves; share the agenda; and explicitly state the objectives, roles, and responsibilities of team members.

#### Discovery

The goal of this section is to understand the project goals and requirements - from a business and a technical perspective.

What is the current state of the application and the desired state? What is the business driver for this change? Are there any pain points?

Capture everything on a whiteboard and/or a note-taking application, such as OneNote.

Avoid discussing the solution at this point

#### Architecture and Solution Design

Design the future state of the application.

Discuss the components that can be used to implement the solution. How do these components communicate with one another? Use a whiteboard and/or whiteboard software to capture this.

For a Java application, consider the following Azure technologies:

* Azure Spring Apps
* Azure App Services
* Azure Container services
* Azure Kubernetes Service

There are likely to be other technologies, such as databases and queuing services that interact with the application.

Identify the non-functional requirements and determine how to handle them. These can include deployment, maintenance, high availability, disaster recovery, logging, and others.

Identify any risks in the proposed solution and provide guidance on mitigating those risks.

Define the architecture and design patterns that will be used in the solution.

Capture everything on a whiteboard and/or a note-taking application, such as OneNote.

Create a "Parking Lot" list for items that are out of scope.

### Follow-up

Take time at the end of the ADS to discuss the next steps.

For the next meeting(s)?

* What is the cadence?
* Who should attend?
* What should be done by whom between now and then?

## <a name="poc"></a>Proof of Concept

We may have uncertainty if a technology is a good fit for our solution. In this case, a Proof of Concept (POC) will help. A Proof of Concept is a small application that demonstrates the capabilities of a technology in a given scenario. This helps us decide if the technology is appropriate for the solution, minimizing risk without investing inordinate time and money.

## <a name="techbriefing"></a>Tech Briefing

The [Microsoft Azure Well Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/) provides guidance on building and migrating an application to Azure. The framework consists of five architectural "pillars":

* Reliability
* Security
* Cost Optimization
* Operational Excellence
* Performance Efficiency

### Reliability

Reliability is the ability to keep an application or service running, to anticipate failures, and to have a plan to recover quickly from those failures.

You can learn more about improving reliability in Azure applications [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/#reliability).

### Security

Security is an important pillar when architecting any application, whether or not it is in Azure. A key principle to keep in mind when designing your application is "Zero Trust" - never assume you can trust the person or account accessing your application.

You can learn more about improving security [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/#security).

**More resources:**

* [Enable end-user authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/web-app-quickstart?pivots=devlang-java)
* [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/migrate-adal-msal-java)
* [Manage app secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-java)

### Cost Optimization

Azure resources can provide, but they cost money. This pillar helps you maximize the value for the price you are paying: Are you getting sufficient value for money outlaid and are there ways to save money, while still meeting your needs?

You can learn more about optimizing cost in Azure applications [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/#cost-optimization).

### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence refers to the ability to deploy an application reliably and to verify that deployment.

You can learn more about improving operational excellence in Azure applications [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/#operational-excellence).

### Performance Efficiency

There are two ways to increase performance and capacity: Scaling up (increasing the power of your servers) and scaling out (increasing the number of nodes).

You can learn more about improving performance efficiency in Azure applications [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/#performance-efficiency).
