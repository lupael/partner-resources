## Learn Kubernetes & AKS through What The Hack

[What the Hack](https://aka.ms/wth) is a set of challenge based hackathons that can be hosted in-person or virtually via Microsoft Teams.

If you are interested in attending a What The Hack event, contact your Microsoft Partner representative.  Alternatively, you can host one yourself using the guidance in the [What The Hack Hosting Guide](https://aka.ms/wthhost)

* [What The Hack: Intro to Kubernetes](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/001-IntroToKubernetes/) (In-person Instructor Led)

This intro level hack will help you get hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes and the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Microsoft Azure. 

The hack starts off by covering containers, what problems they solve, and why Kubernetes is needed to help orchestrate them. You will learn all of the Kubernetes jargon (pods, services, and deployments, oh my!). By the end, you should have a good understanding of what Kubernetes is and be familiar with how to run it on Azure.

* [What The Hack: Advanced Kubernetes](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/023-AdvancedKubernetes/) (In-person Instructor Led)

If you've gone through the [Intro to Kubernetes WTH](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/001-IntroToKubernetes/), now you know the jargon.  Pods, services, and YAML are second nature to you. This hack will dive into more advanced features of Kubernetes itself. Unlike the intro level hack where the challenges build on each other, this hack is more of a "choose your own adventure". Once you get a Kubernetes cluster running with the hack's sample application, you can dive deep into any or all of the covered areas you are interested in.

Topics include: Helm, Resiliency, Scaling, GitOps, Service Mesh, and Data Volumes.

* [What The Hack: AKS - Enterprise Grade](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/039-AKSEnterpriseGrade/) (In-person Instructor Led)

In the [Intro To Kubernetes WTH](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/001-IntroToKubernetes/), you learn the basics of Kubernetes itself. You may know how to deploy a basic cluster, but do you know how to get it ready for production in an Enterprise environment? Kubernetes can run in any cloud or on-premises, but knowing the integration points with the underlying platform is important.

This hack focuses on the integration between Kubernetes, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and other Azure services. You will explore how to integrate an AKS cluster into your existing private network and make it secure.  This includes configuring policies to limit access to the cluster, configuring secrets with Azure Key Vault, and how to monitor your cluster with Azure's monitoring tools.
