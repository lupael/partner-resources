## Feedback

Have a content session recommendation or general feedback? Here's how to give it:
* Use of [feedback form to let us know](https://aka.ms/ada-feedback)
* Create a [documentation issue in GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PartnerResources/issues/new?labels=feedback&title=Azure%20Data%20Academy%20feedback) to begin a conversation.

Not sure which to use? To fire off a quick suggestion, use the Office Form. It's quick and anonymous. If you'd like to start a dialog on a topic, use the Issues in GitHub with the 'feedback' label.
