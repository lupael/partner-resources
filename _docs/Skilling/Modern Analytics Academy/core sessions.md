# Modern Analytics Academy - Core Sessions

The Modern Analytics Academy core sessions consist of the original sessions created to walk through a modern analytics solution, from data creation/ingestion through warehousing and visualization. Each session is designed to be stand-alone, but also part of a cohesive architecture.
