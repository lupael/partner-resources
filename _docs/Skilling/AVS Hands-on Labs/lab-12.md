# AVS HOL LAB12B – Configure HCX (HoL)

VMware HCX is included as part of Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud and offers
many ways to migrate workloads and can be used for disaster recovery operations.

The deployment of HCX takes a bit of time and requires specifics in an on-prem
environment. This training will not be able to facilitate such an on-prem
environment as well that would take too much of this training valuable time.

Since HCX is a very important capability in the platform for most for migration
purposes you will use a VMware Hand-On Lab to be able to (virtually) get
hands-on with HCX. Please continue via the link below. This HoL will walk you
through the following stages of the HCX process.

You will be downloading, deploying, and configuring VMware HCX on-premises,
including all its components (Interconnect, Network Extension, and WAN
Optimization). Then we will connect our on-premises environment via site pairing
and stretch our Apps network to the Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud for
zero-downtime migration.

## Lab Modules

1. VMware HCX Deployment and Installation

2. VMware HCX Site Pairing and Components Configuration

3. VMware HCX Network Extension and Workload Migration

   You’ll need to register (create an account) at VMware Hands-On Lab platform
   to access the lab.
