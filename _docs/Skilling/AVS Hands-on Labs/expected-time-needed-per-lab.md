## Important Notes

1. **Labs 1 through 10 are the required labs for this training course**. Other
   labs are extra, considered as bonus exercises if time allows and/or for fast
   paced participant.

2. **The labs are sequential, especially the first 10**. For example, you’ll
   need to setup networking before you create a VM in AVS Private Cloud. And
   you’ll need to deploy Nginx Web Server on the VM before trying to publish
   the Web App to Internet inbound access.

3. The **letter (B)** next to the Lab number means that this is a bonus lab.

4. The **asterisk (\*)** next to some Labs titles means that this lab is for
   observation only, and the actions inside have been already taken as part of
   pre-staging the lab environment.
