# AVS HOL LAB4 – Enable Internet Access to Azure VMware Solution

> This step has been performed part of pre-provisioning the lab environment.  
>
> However, it is still helpful to understand the steps that has been taken.

After you have deployed AVS Private Cloud. You can enable Internet Access from
your AVS workloads to the Internet by following the steps below. This operation
will take between 15-20 minutes.

Using an Internet Browser go to Azure Portal (<https://portal.azure.com>), then
search for “Azure VMware Solution”. Click on the instance you have previously
deployed, then under **Manage**, click on **Connectivity,** and select
**Settings**.

1. Under **Internet enabled**, you’ll see that it is **Disabled** by default.
